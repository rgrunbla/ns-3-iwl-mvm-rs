# ns-3-iwl-mvm-rs

This repository contains the code associated with the paper "Simulation and Performance Evaluation of the Intel Rate Adaptation Algorithm". You can find the paper at [this address](https://remy.grunblatt.org/pdfs/Simulation_and_Performance_Evaluation_of_the_Intel_Rate_Adaptation_Algorithm.pdf).

This code implements the Intel Rate Adaptation Algorithm (Iwl-Mvm-Rs), a rate adaptation algorithm used in pretty much all modern Intel hardware, for the [NS-3 simulator](https://www.nsnam.org/).

As of today, this code is compatible with NS-3 version 3.30.
